------------------------------
            final object        child class     parent class
public            pass            pass            pass
protected         fail            pass            pass
private           fail            fail            pass

-----------------------------
cannot create an instance of an abstract class (new)
thie idea of abstract classes is to inherit
- we must use all the abstract property from parent class to child class


all the interface property should be public


// types can not have same typename but can in interface
// ----------------------------------------- abstract class vs interface
//  abstract class methods automatically available in child class because we extends
// in interface will have call signature and must implement in class

// classes can implement multiple interfaces but can only inheret one parent class

// abstract classes can have static method buit interface cannot have a static

difference between arrow and function is this binding
